# Palindrome Matrix Checker

A C++ program that checks if a 3x3 matrix is a palindrome row-wise.

## How It Works

- The program uses a fixed 3x3 matrix.
- Prints the matrix.
- Checks if each row in the matrix reads the same forward and backward (palindrome).
- Prints whether the matrix is a palindrome or not.

## How to Run

1. Download the code.
2. Open it with any C++ editor.
3. Compile:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o matrix
   ```
4. Run:
   ```bash
   ./matrix
   ```

## Example Output

```
Matrix 1 : 
  1   2   1 
  5   2   5 
  7   3   7 

Yes : This is Palindrome Matrix
```

If the matrix is not a palindrome, the output will be:

```
No : This is NOT Palindrome Matrix
```
